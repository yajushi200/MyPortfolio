    <h3><b><i>Our customer's feedback</i></b></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Before choosing a real estate agent, I conducted a lot of research to see who would be the best choice based
            on
            the investment they make into selling the property (time and effort, not necessarily financially) and how
            they
            promote their listings. The Yajushi Real Estate Team stood out as the best Louisville has to offer: their
            organic rankings are excellent (meaning people find listings on his site easily), their social media
            presence
            was strong, and I could tell they put a lot of work into their listings.</li>
        <br>
        <li>We were so fortunate to have found Yajushi Garg when we moved to Toronto. As our Realtor, she helped us find
            the right house in the right neighborhood for the right price. She was patient as we traveled from Ohio to
            look at homes over several months and cautioned us about making unreasonable offers when we fell too quickly
            for overpriced homes.We would recommend her to anyone.</li>
        <br>
        <li>I recently had the pleasure of working with Yajushi Garg when looking for my home. From day 1, she
            was extremely responsive and had great suggestions for homes to view based on what I was looking for. All
            throughout the negotiations and closing she was there quickly handling any issues that may have
            risen. If the time ever comes when I will be looking for a new home, there isn't any question on who my
            Realtor will be!</li>
